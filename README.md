# Simple NixOS + Home Manager Configuration with Flakes

>**Warning**: This project **only works on WSL** environments. It is not guaranteed to work on general Linux yet.

This repository provides a simple and modular Nix Flake setup for configuring a NixOS system and Home Manager. It’s designed to make managing a NixOS system with user-specific configurations more scalable and reproducible.

## Features

* [x] NixOS system configuration
* [x] Home Manager integration for user environments
* [x] Managing settings via external file(my-config.toml)
* [x] Supports private ssh key via ssh.private_key_path in my-coinfig.toml
* [x] Supports Direnv(nix-direnv)
* [x] Supports VS Code for WSL
* [x] Supports win32yank for clipboard sync
* [ ] Supports Docker
* [ ] Supports Linux
* [ ] More useful packages

## Requirements

- This guide is based on the WSL environment installed on Windows OS.
- Download [the latest version](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL/releases/latest) of NixOS-WSL.
  - Refer to [this site](https://github.com/nix-community/NixOS-WSL) to install it.
- **Nix** with experimental features enabled for Flakes:
  - To enable Flakes, add `experimental-features = nix-command flakes` to your `~/.config/nix/nix.conf`.
- If you successfully entered the basic shell(probably "bash") of the NixOS by entering the command below preparations are complete in **cmd** or **power shell**, you are ready.
  ```powershell
  wsl -d NixOS
  ```

## Getting Started

### 0. Let's proceed assuming that you are in the shell such as bash of NixOS.

### 1. Enable experimental features for Flakes
The following settings are required to use the commands below.
```bash
export NIX_CONFIG="experimental-features = nix-command flakes"
```

### 2. Install Git, Vim on nix shell

Since git and vim are not installed on NixOS-WSL, install them in the nix-shell environment.
```bash
nix shell nixpkgs#git nixpkgs#vim
```
### 3. Clone the Repository

```bash
cd /tmp #or wherever you want
git clone https://github.com/terdong/my-nixos-config
cd my-nixos-config
```
- But if the parent directory is not /tmp, change the value of config_path key in the my-config.toml to the full path you changed.
  ```toml
  #./my-config.toml
  [nixos]
  config_path = "/tmp/my-nixos-config"
  ```

### 4. Edit your settings in ./my-config.toml
```bash
vi my-config.toml #or nano editor works too
```
- <ins>_**It must be changed, especially:**_</ins>
  ```toml
  [user]
  name = "YOUR_NAME" #<- At least this value should be changed. It will become not only user name, but also your home directory name.
  ```

### 5. Initialize NixOS with Flakes

```bash
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
```

### 6. Reboot NixOS

- After exiting the shell, reboot NixOS-WSL with the following command in cmd or powershell.
  ```powershell
  wsl -t NixOS #terminate
  #And then
  wsl -d NixOS #distribution
  ```

- Most directories have their own default.nix file, which contains settings relevant to that directory.
- When you import a directory in nix file, the default.nix file in that directory is automatically read.

## Tips
- User's packages, alias, environment variables and path can be set in my-config.toml.
  - For reference, if nothing changes after changing the values and rebuilding, exit the shell and re-enter.
  ```toml
  #./my-config.toml
  [home]
  #Set packages you want to install. You can find available packages at https://search.nixos.org/packages
  #'wget' is already included internally.(Check out ./home/default.nix);
  packages = ["bat", "curl", "ripgrep", "tree", "jq", "httpie", "htop", "fd", "tmux"]

  #Set additional PATHs for user session.
  sessionPath = [
    #"/mnt/c/Users/YOUR_NAME/AppData/Local/Programs/Microsoft VS Code/bin",
    #"/mnt/c/Users/YOUR_NAME/scoop/apps/win32yank/0.1.1"
  ]

  #Set environment variables for user session.
  [home.sessionVariables]
  #JAVA_HOME = "/usr/lib/jvm/default-java"

  #Set aliases for user session.
  [home.shellAliases]
  #ports = "netstat -tunlp"
  #meminfo = "free -m -l -t -h"
  ```
- System aliases can be added in ./nixos/modules/aliases.nix , and shell aliases can be added for a config file of each shell , such as ./home/programs/zsh/default.nix.
  ```nix
  # ./nixos/modules/aliases/default.nix
  environment.shellAliases = {
    nalias = "..."; # this is for listing all aliases below
    gspm = "git stash push my-config.toml";
    gsp = "git stash pop";
    nrf = "sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake";
    nrfd = "nrf .";
    nfc = "nix flake check";
    nfcd = "nfc .";
    npull = "pushd /home/${myConfig.user.name}/.dotfiles/${myConfig.nixos.bkp_conf_dir_name} && git stash push my-config.toml && git pull --rebase && git stash pop && popd";
    nupdate = "nrf /home/${myConfig.user.name}/${myConfig.nixos.bkp_conf_dir_name}";
  };

  #./home/programs/zsh/default.nix
  programs.zsh.shellAliases = {
      reload = "source $HOME/.zshrc";
  };
  ```

- To get alias list, you can use the following command:
  - "nalias": this shows the nix rebuilding related aliases.
  - "git alias": this shows the git related aliases.

- Updating flake.lock: Run below to pull in the latest dependencies defined in the Flake.
  ```bash
  nix flake update
  ```
- Flake files verification(this is a command to check if the modified files are correct and valid before rebuilding flake)
  ```bash
  # current path
  nix flake check .
  #or more details
  nix flake check . --show-trace

  # Also --show-trace option can be added "nixos-rebuild" command
  # sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake . --show-trace
  ```
- Rebuilding NixOS
  ```bash
  # current path
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake .
  #or
  # specific path
  sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake ./my-nixos-config
  ```
- Convenient direnv related snippets
  ```nix
  #./home/default.nix
  shellAliases = {
      nixify = "..."; # To quickly add a default.nix
      flakify = "..."; # To quickly add a flake.nix
      scalafy = "..."; # For scala projects only
  };

  ```

## Troubleshooting
- Permissions: Ensure you have the correct permissions for the files and directories.
- File System: If you encounter read-only file system errors, ensure the NixOS and Home directories are writable.
- Nix Commands: If Flake commands don’t work, confirm "experimental-features = nix-command flakes" is set in your Nix config.
- If you have added files and run "nixos-rebuild switch --flake ." and it says 'No such file or directory', Run "git add *"
- On Linux not WSL: As mentioned earlier, it has not been tested in a general Linux environment, but it is expected that there will be no problem if "./nixos/platforms/linux/default.nix" is ​​set properly.
- my-config.toml: Nix follows the principle of purity. Therefore, it cannot create an impurity situation where it loads external files or newly added files, so it has no choice but to manage files as they are. If you want to update to the latest version from github, I recommend using the simple and convenient "npull" alias(assuming only my-config.toml has changed).
- How to fix a clipboard(for copy and paste two way) not working in WSL environment:
  - Add the path such as "/mnt/c/Users/YOUR_NAME/scoop/apps/win32yank/0.1.1" after installing win32yank on windows somehow in home.sessionPath
  ```toml
  #./my-config.toml
  [home]
  sessionPath = [
  "/mnt/c/Users/YOUR_NAME/scoop/apps/win32yank/0.1.1"
  ]
  ```

    <summary>Fixed issues</summary>

  - ~~After the first rebuild switch, you may see an error message like this. So far, there doesn't seem to be any critical issues.~~ This problem occurs when the base version of nixpkgs does not match the OS version (e.g. unstable).
    ```bash
    Error: Failed to open dbus connection

    Caused by:
        Failed to connect to socket /run/user/1000/bus: Connection refused
    ```
